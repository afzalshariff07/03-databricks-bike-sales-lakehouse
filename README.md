# Enterprise-Grade Databricks Lakehouse Implementation

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a production-style **Data Lakehouse architecture** implemented on Databricks using the Medallion (Bronze–Silver–Gold) framework.

The project simulates CRM and ERP source systems integrated into a unified analytical model to support Sales and Customer Analytics use cases.

It covers the full lifecycle:

- Data ingestion
- Data transformation & cleansing
- Dimensional modeling
- Pipeline orchestration
- Performance optimization

---

## Project Objective

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete **Data Lakehouse architecture** using Databricks and the Medallion (Bronze–Silver–Gold) framework.

The objective is to simulate how modern data platforms are built in enterprise environments — starting from raw source data and progressively transforming it into clean, validated, analytics-ready datasets.

The implementation includes:

- End-to-end ingestion of CRM and ERP datasets
- Structured Medallion architecture design
- Data quality enforcement and validation
- Dimensional modeling using a star schema
- Notebook orchestration and automation
- Delta Lake optimization techniques

This implementation reflects best practices used in enterprise data engineering teams for building scalable and maintainable Lakehouse platforms.

## Business Scenario

Organizations often operate multiple systems (CRM, ERP, operational databases).  
This project demonstrates how raw operational data can be consolidated and transformed into analytics-ready fact and dimension tables using modern Lakehouse architecture.

The final Gold layer supports:

- Sales performance analysis
- Customer segmentation
- Product analytics
- Business KPI reporting
- Executive dashboard consumption

## Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** pattern.

### 🥉 Bronze Layer – Raw Ingestion

- Ingest raw CRM and ERP datasets
- Store data in Delta format
- Maintain schema consistency
- Support incremental ingestion
- Preserve source-level granularity

### 🥈 Silver Layer – Data Standardization

- Data cleansing and validation
- Type casting and schema enforcement
- Deduplication and business rule application
- Creation of standardized, conformed datasets

### 🥇 Gold Layer – Business Transformation

- Star schema dimensional modeling
- Creation of fact and dimension tables
- Aggregated KPI-ready datasets
- Optimized tables for BI and analytics consumption
